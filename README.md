Hello! I’m an aspiring 2nd year Electrical Engineer with a strong passion for robotics, embedded systems, and
innovative problem-solving. My interests lie in creating solutions that merge hardware and software into
practical, real-world applications. From designing Bluetooth-controlled RC cars to building smart security
systems with integrated sensors and locking mechanisms, I enjoy every stage of the process and I’m always keen
to learn more.
